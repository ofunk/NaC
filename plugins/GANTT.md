## Status

| Plugin | Purpose | Status | Next gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `noc-regulated-core` | Shared regulated workflow guardrails | Baseline ready | Recheck GPT Store/workspace packaging assumptions. |
| `noc-kg-editor` | Local no-code editor for usecase knowledge graphs | Installable MVP | Bind Markdown session-sheet and JSON view to future ChatGPT App or GPT Action surface without storing mandate values. |
| `noc-idaas` | German eID verification and IAM projection readiness | Active | Confirm connector boundary and data-processing basis before any production pilot. |
| `noc-cyberjack-rfid` | Local card, RFID-off, SAK and XNP local-interface readiness | Active | Windows DriverPackage, morris middleware, optional morris loopback API/PCSC probe and Linux driver preflight are implemented; current local gate still needs a connected cyberJack reader or manual attestation. |
| `noc-bnotk-xnp` | XNP authentication readiness | Active | Runnable local reader-prompt evidence now binds XNP preflight to the CyberJack gate and can pass through the optional morris API probe; next gate is workstation validation with XNP installed. |
| `noc-pkcs7-certbundle` | Local PKCS#7/P7B certificate-bundle evidence without signing | Active | Installable MVP added with metadata-only local inspection, no PFX/PKCS#12 import, no private-key access and no signature operation; CI hardening removes PEM-shaped test literals from source fixtures. |
| `noc-handelsregister` | Register filing readiness | Active | Bind to GmbH formation usecase. |
| `noc-bea-portal` | beA workflow companion | Planned | Confirm notary-office priority. |
| `noc-elster-eric` | ELSTER/ERiC companion | Planned | Keep separate from notarial core unless needed. |
| `noc-grundbuch-portal` | Land register companion | Planned | Bind to purchase-contract starter. |
| `noc-oci-evidence` | OCI evidence operations | Planned | Keep as infrastructure/evidence plugin, not a usecase. |

## Packaging Note

OpenAI GPT Store publication and workspace app installation are different
channels. Public GPT Store packages must be checked against current OpenAI
publishing rules before release; workspace-only apps and internal notary pilots
remain a separate track.
